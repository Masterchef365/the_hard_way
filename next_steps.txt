Needs to have one uniform buffer per swapchain image
So we need to make allocations, which means we need access to the allocator
And also we should probably restructure the swapchain so that not everything is linked together

* Vertex and index buffers for each object
* Fill out the command buffers for every object, binding appropriate pipelines as necessary
    * You will want to group objects by pipeline/material
* Uniforms and descriptor sets
    * Upload camera matrix each frame

The swapchain thing should be simplified, command buffers should be moved out

Need to have one uniform buffer per frame, because we don't want to update it while it's being used
Each pipeline has a layout
